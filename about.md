My name’s Jennifer, but people call me Jenny, Jen… Jeh… I don’t mind being called anything, as long as it’s derived from my first name. I’m fluent in English, Spanish and Italian.

I started my career in education.  I was a foreign language teacher at a small language school for sometime and went on to teach 2nd grade bilingual education in the south Bronx. After sometime, I needed a change of setting and found a job as a Health Coach at a health and wellness program after some volunteer work.  Part of my responsibility there was to collaborate with the research team of the sponsor organization, where I developed a fascination for data-tracking.

As a result, I started to learn programming on the side, quit my job and went to the Flatiron School.  I now work as an Associate Software Engineer at XO Group, where I continue to hone my skills with great people, who are both very talented and invested in my professional development.
