title: A Word From a Junior
---

Having been programming for just a few months now, I can recognize good code when I see it, but I still have a world of things to learn about writing quality software. 

While you may think that as a Junior, I need a lot of positive reinforcement to do my job, my reinforcement is the desire to be productive and contribute.  My motivation is discovering a growing sense of comfort when working independently on stories.  I'm driven when I see my ideas acknowledged and respected.  If I needed high-fives every time I reformatted a small piece of code, then perhaps I should be rethinking my career choice.  However, I want to be a great software engineer!  This is the career I want to devote my life to and want to continue learning and growing every day, with your support. Don't confuse support with praise. When I open a pull request, I am more interested in what I can improve.  Tell me what I did wrong!  Don't be afraid of critizicing every line because at the end of the day -- THAT's what's going to teach me the most... so please -- be thorough:

- Question my logic. Ask for clarifications!
- Ask me to refactor.
- Comment on my method names, variable names, etc.
- Tell me if something is deprecated.
- Comment on the style.
- Ask for better documentation.

By giving me constructive criticism, you're helping me hone the hard and soft skills that are going to make me a better engineer.  And I'm not the only one who will benefit from this -- your feedback will make me a better person to work with because I'll be able to deliver better quality software.
