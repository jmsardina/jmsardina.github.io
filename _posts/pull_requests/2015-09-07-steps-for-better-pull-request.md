title: Thoughts on Pull Requests
---
Background
----
Working as a professional developer, we constantly have the opportunity to tackle new problems.  Unfortunately, we don't get to program 100% of the time since there are process and administrative tasks to take care of as well.  Part of our time as developers we spend reviewing other people's work in pull requests to ensure the quality and integrity of our codebase.

Reviewing pull requests should be quick and easy.  If you have to spend an entire day just reviewing one pull request, you might as well just complete the story yourself. Considering code-review plays a significant role in our day-to-day, I wanted to take some time to look at some of the ways to make this process as smooth as possible for both the requester and the reviewer.

I hope you find my ideas useful, or at least worth considering, but remember -- they're just my ideas.  Let me know what you think!
