Whether you're adding an entire feature or just changing the name of a variable, good code should always be your inspiration.  Similarly, when you're reviewing pull requests, be thorough.  Don't be afraid of commenting on anything and everything and asking lots of questions.  That's the point of pull requests!  We should be questioning each other's work and making sure that we're deploying quality over quantity.

And yes -- style does matter! If you see consistent violations of style, have that person revise and update the branch.  It may seem unnecessary and time-consuming at the beginning, but if you don't let it slide now, you'll see that addressing these issues with become second-nature to everyone.

__Should you always push back a pull requests because of style?__

No.  Use your judgement!  Feedback is supposed to help us write better code, but if the person just happened to use 3 spaces instead of 2 -- and you know that was just a typo, just fetch the branch and resolve this yourself.  There's no need to make this process even longer.  You can always leave a note for the requester letting them know of this small change -- hopefully they'll be more careful next time.
